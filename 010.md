### Who?

**Github**: [Nick Guletskii](https://github.com/nickguletskii)

**Project**: [GLXOSD](https://github.com/nickguletskii/GLXOSD)

### Why?

According to the contributor's [post](https://github.com/nickguletskii/GLXOSD/issues/109) inside of the project's issue forum, they have a few reasons for disengaging. 

The first reason was regarding time, while pursuing both their schooling and commerical projects they didn't have the time to maintain the project anymore. 

> Unfortunately, due to my mathematics undergrad degree and commercial  projects, I no longer have the time to maintain and support GLXOSD.

With the lack of ways to test code automatically, the project in itself was time consuimg as well. The other issue was that the direction the project was going in, and it's lack of support for what the community was starting to pick up on. 

> It can also be said that GLXOSD is outdated. Wayland is starting to gain traction in end user oriented distributions and GLXOSD doesn't have any support for pure Wayland applications due to its reliance on X11 APIs.

These two reasons unfortunately led to disengagment.
