**Project:** [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node)

**Date:** September 2016

### Why?

Tracy Hinds, Gregor Martynus, along with other Node.js contributors discussed their experiences behind why newer contributors avoid or disengage from open source, more specifically Node.js at faster rates. After this episode, Tracy stopped actively contributing (most noticably in May 2018) and completely stopped contributions to open source projects in November 2019. On the otherhand, Gregor has actively contributed to open source projects since 2014 and shows no sign of decreasing their activity.

Despite their activity, both found reasons that caused contributors to disengage. Tracy claimed that contributors don't feel comfortable particpating in the project because of biases and barriers created by varying skill levels, methods of communication (such as language and formality), and personal experiences (which make it difficult to join the larger Node.js community).

> "Those thought barriers and biases that we've we've placed that we need to remove in order for people to feel like they can contribute." (28:08) - Tracy

Tracy strongly advocated to break down the barriers, but the inability to break down those barriers was eventually what led Tracy to leave open source as well.

> "Focusing on community is a really really big and important part of my sanity as an open source developer." (28:14) - Tracy

Node.js was not the kind of community Tracy wanted which eventually led them to reduce contributions until they no longer contributed at all.

Gregor cited similar concerns to Tracy. Gregor adds that burnout is a significant issue for all contributors and this unwelcoming culture just adds to it. Gregor even claims they may be part of the problem.

> "They don't feel welcome because there's a certain kind of people who really enjoy the work open source projects mostly world today and they really liked it and when someone who is different looks at these projects and sees the tone in them and sees you know what kind of people are contributing and how there are threats." (34:58) - Gregor

Gregor feels their work could intimidate newer contributors and also prevent other less active contributors to leave. What's more, Gregor claims they're recieving threats as a core maintainer which cause other contributors to disengage for fear of recieving some themselves.

### Interventions

Tracy and Gregor encourage contributors to incorporate different people's interests in the project so everyone can feel welcome and get involved easily. They cite burnout on multiple occaissions and encourage contributors to take a couple days off to relax and reduce any tensions they may feel.

> "The only way we can take on the success of the project is if we have a healthy community that identifies with that community and takes ownership" (25:50) - Gregor

Gregor worries not all contributors are feeling involved and thus are not taking as much responsibility. In order for a community to function properly, Gregor recommends everyone in that community pay attention to their actions and support their peers.
