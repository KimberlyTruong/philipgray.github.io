### Who?

**Github:** [Pedro Nauck](pedronauck)

**Project:** [Docz](https://www.docz.site)

**Date:** 06/03/2021

### Why?

As issues continued to pile up, project creator Pedro Nauck wrote an [apology](https://github.com/pedronauck/docz/issues/1634) to the docz community. They brought up how as the project continued to grow in popularity, things became increasingly more complicated. The one way street between developer and end-user was rough, and it caused them to disengage. 

> When the project starts to have a lot of people using it, it's more  complicated yet. People want a lot of things from you and your project,  big companies are using the project and need a lot of things as well  from it in order to keep their projects healthy, but in most of the  cases this is a talk in just one way. *There are more people interest in have things from you, than help!* **And this crashed me 😕**

They then went onto talking about how he came to a crossroads -- their health was compromised and they needed to make a decision in regards to that. 

> So, after a time working a lot here and on my business, I was with my healthy compromised and **needed to choose between "keep my open source project" or "keep my mental and physical health"**. And for me the choice was very clear, I choose me.
