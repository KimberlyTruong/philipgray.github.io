### Who?

**Github:** [ossanna16](https://github.com/ossanna16)

**Project:** [Django](https://github.com/django/django)

### Why?

Anna cited three reasons for leaving their open source communities at DjangoCon US in 2018. These reasons arose because they had to change their priorities as new events unfolded in their life. The first issue was the lack of a work life balance as newer, more important responsibilities arose.

> "People's living situations change or your priorities change and so people may say after a while I can't do it anymore for whatever reason." (15:44)

> "Tech kind of takes over our whole life. I'm definitely guilty of that so I'm kind of like actively saying no." (30:00)

This led to a lack of time internally due to their shift in priorities. Although they still appreciated the Django community, Anna found contributing to open source to take away from more significant priorities, like a new job and changing living situtations.

> "I'm actually moving cities so I also kind of want to prioritize my personal life a little more I've served the community a lot and now it's kind of like time to look after myself a little more I'm out I also took on this PSF thing which is a huge job and so I needed to get rid of something else on my plate." (17:06)

Finally, Anna felt it was the right time to quit since the spark that originally led them to contribute to open source software was no longer there.

> "There were it's just a feeling that told me it's time to pass it onto someone else so if you feel like you're not totally enjoying yourself anymore I think that's a good time to quit." (17:28)
