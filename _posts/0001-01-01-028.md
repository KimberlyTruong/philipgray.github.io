### Who?

**Github:** [Ben Noordhuis](https://github.com/bnoordhuis)

**Project:** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), and [libuv](https://libuv.org/)

### Why?

The Node.js foundation made a [post](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/uncategorized/bnoordhuis-departure/) that a longtime contributor, Ben Noordhuis, was stepping away from both Node.js and libuv. 

A few days prior to this announcement, the steward of Node.js at the time, Joyent, made this [announcement](https://www.joyent.com/blog/the-power-of-a-pronoun). 

Now what prompted all of this? Ben made the decision to reject a [pull request](https://github.com/joyent/libuv/pull/1015#issue-10401121) that was trying to get rid of the use of a gendered pronoun in the libuv code. In response to the pull request, Ben said the following: 

> [Sorry, not interested in trival changes like that.](https://github.com/joyent/libuv/pull/1015#issuecomment-29538615)

The request was then merged by the Node.js project lead at the time, Isaac Schlueter. In retaliation to Isaac's actions, Ben then [attempted to revert that merge.](https://github.com/joyent/libuv/commit/804d40ee14dc0f82c482dcc8d1c41c14333fcb48) 

> @isaacs may have his commit bit but that does not mean he is at liberty
> to land patches at will.  All patches have to be signed off by either
> me or Bert.  Isaac, consider yourself chided.
>
> This reverts commit 47d98b6.

A few days later, Ben [attempted to clarify](https://github.com/joyent/libuv/pull/1015#issuecomment-29568172) their actions. They also said:

> I'm probably going to step back from libuv and node.js core  development.  I do it more out a sense of duty than anything else.  If  this is what I have to deal with, then I'd just as rather do something  else.  Hope that clears things up.  Thanks.
