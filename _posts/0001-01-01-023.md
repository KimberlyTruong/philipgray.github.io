### Who?

**Github:** [George Claghorn](https://github.com/georgeclaghorn)

**Project:** [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)

**Date:** 04/30/2021

### Why?

A significant number of employees left [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/) following a fairly [controversial decision](https://world.hey.com/jason/changes-at-basecamp-7f32afc5) by the leadership to ban societal and political discussion in their internal chats.  One of the employees who announced they were leaving was George, who [tweeted](https://twitter.com/georgeclaghorn/status/1388131009531719680?s=20) the following:

> I left Basecamp today.

He then shortly followed up with him announcing that he was disengaging from Rails (Basecamp invented Rails):

> I’ve also resigned from the Rails core team.
