### Why?

Rowan [tweeted](https://twitter.com/rowanmanning/status/1034375191890210817) about a number of issues piling up among Pa11y and it's related projects. They mentioned how they were, "feeling a bit burned out and struggling to find time to dedicate to open source."

Also, according to their blog about me:

> I maintained [Pa11y](https://pa11y.org/), an accessibility  testing tool, and other free software projects until I got super burned  out by open source. Now I use my spare time to play D&D (I love the world-building) or Minecraft (I love the world-building).

Not much more information was given regarding the exact nature of their burnout.
