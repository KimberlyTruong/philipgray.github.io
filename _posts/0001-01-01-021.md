### Who?

**Github:** [Bruno Oliveira](https://github.com/nicoddemus), [Anthony Sottile](https://github.com/asottile), and [Ronny Pfannschmidt](https://github.com/RonnyPfannschmidt)

**Project:** [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest)

### Why?

Bruno had sent an [email](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/pytest-dev/2020-April/004939.html) to the pytest developer mailing list, talking about how he was leaving the project. He said brought up that there was a sole individual who caused him to leave the project. 

> However, the past months or so one individual has drained my will to workn on the project because of his interactions, so I decided it is best that I leave the project for a while and focus on other things.

But it didn't stop there... Anthony [replied](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/pytest-dev/2020-April/004940.html) to Bruno, announcing that he was leaving as well. He too was leaving because of a single individual. 

> Also echoing the concerns of Bruno I'll be stepping down from my role as
> core developer on pytest.
>
> I love working on the project but cannot continue to do so when working with a particular individual has been extremely draining. I, in good faith, cannot continue to represent a project which enables this individual's behaviour towards other contributors and users.

Then Ronny [replied](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/pytest-dev/2020-April/004941.html), mentioning that "joy is absent" and as a result he will be joining Anthony and Bruno. 

> after contemplaing a while i decided to join Bruno and Anthony. When i returned from my hiatus i declared that joy will be important,
>
> currently that joy is absent.
