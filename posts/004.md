### Who?

GitHub: [damianh](https://github.com/damianh)

Project: [NEventStore](https://github.com/NEventStore/NEventStore)

### Why?

This contributor cited three reasons why they were leaving in their [blog post](https://dhickey.ie/2015/04/17/stepping-down-from-neventstore/). The first of which is that they've learned how to build better systems that no longer use the project (NEventStore) anymore and as a result, is no longer useful for them. 

> the core reason is that as I've as learned to build event sourced  systems over the years, NEventStore's current design no longer works for me.

Which leads us into our second reason, project disagreements. They had the option to change the project into something that was useful for them, but the community also depended on the current iteration of the project. 

> I *could* mould NEventStore into how *I'd* like it to be but then the changes would very likely alienate people and break their stuff.  

The third problem, was that there wasn't enough time, which wasn't the straw that broke the camel's back but it was just another factor. 

> While I'm fairly stretched time wise, ...

All together -- these factors contributed to them disengaging from the project.

> Thus it's best that I head off in my own direction.

> If you are vested into NEventStore and would like to take over and  run a popular OSS project (nearly 800 stars and 250 forks on github, and 10's of thousands of nuget downloads), please reach out to me :)
