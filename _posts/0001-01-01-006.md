### Who?

GitLab: [LinxGem33](https://gitlab.com/LinxGem33)

Project: [ArcMenu](https://gitlab.com/LinxGem33/Arc-Menu)

#### Why?

According to their [post](https://gitlab.com/LinxGem33/Arc-Menu/-/issues/358), there were two main reasons for them disengaging with the project they founded. The first of which is that the GNOME desktop enviroment's started to pick up pace in regards to it's development cycle.  This left many third party developers behind, many of which were struggling to keep up. 

> Over the last year the team have seen the rapid improvement to the GNOME desktop and its meant that most extension developers have had to play cat and mouse to keep up with all the new changes,

> we also acknowledge this is the price of progress and "oh boy" has GNOME progressed over this year alone, but for humble third party extension developers this has meant that we have had to constantly chase our tails to meet the aggressive development cycle of GNOME

The second problem, which ties in with the first, was that aggressive development cycle of GNOME unfortunately led a enjoyable hobby to start feeling like work.

> and in the end its meant that I'm no longer enjoying what i was doing and it felt like work not a hobby.

Fortunately, with this contributor leaving, another person stepped up to maintain the project. 

> As mentioned ArcMenu hopefully isn't going to stop when i step down but rather @AndrewZaech has kindly said he would take maintainer-ship for the foreseeable future, and guys your in good hands he has been responsible for a lot of the new features we now have in ArcMenu, so with most open source projects its never really the end :)
