### Who?

**Github:** [TJ Holowaychuk](https://github.com/tj)

**Project:** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

**Date:** 07/03/2014

### Why?

According to TJ's [blogpost](https://medium.com/code-adventures/farewell-node-js-4ba9e7f3e52b), he was parting ways with Nodejs. TJ had been a prominent contributor in the Node.js community, with [hundreds](https://www.npmjs.com/~tjholowaychuk) of packages authored by him so his departure was a surprise to many. 

One of the issues he had was with the direction Node.js was heading in. 

> The more I’ve been working with distributed systems, the more I’m frustrated by Node’s direction, which favours performance over usability and robustness.

With other languages that were better suited to his needs, it's clear why he was becoming uninterested. 

> Node does some things well, but ultimately it’s not the right tool for the type of software I’m interested in these days.
