### Who?

**Github:** [Vitaly Slobo3din](https://github.com/vitallium)

**Project:** [PhantomJS](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs)

**Date:** 04/13/2017

### Why?

Google Chrome had announced that a headless version of itself was coming, and unfortunately prompted PhantomJS maintainer, Vitaly Slobodin, to [announce](https://groups.google.com/g/phantomjs/c/9aI5d-LDuNE) that they were stepping down from the project. They believed that Chrome is faster, more stable and now with headless support there was no way PhantomJS could compete anymore. 

> I think people will switch to it, eventually. Chrome is faster and  more stable than PhantomJS. And it doesn't eat memory like crazy.
>
> I don't see any future in developing PhantomJS.

On top of that, they were struggling to support the project as well.

> Even with recently released 2.5 Beta version with new and shiny  QtWebKit, I can't physically support all 3 platforms at once (I even  bought the Mac for that!). We have no support.

About a year later (March 2018) the [project was archived](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/15344) due to lack of active contributors.
