### Who?

**GitHub:** [Derek Foreman](https://github.com/ManMower)

**Projects:** [Wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/), and [Weston](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/)

**Date:** 04/05/2019

### Why?

Following his departure at Samsung Research, which had him working on both Wayland and Weston, Derek Foreman announced that he was stepping down via [email](https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/wayland-devel/2019-April/040389.html) citing that he doesn't have enough time anymore. 

> Hi everyone,
>
> I no longer have as much time to dedicate to this as I used to, so I
> think it would be best if someone else could take over managing the
> releases for Weston and Wayland.
>
> Thanks for the opportunity to help out,
> Derek
