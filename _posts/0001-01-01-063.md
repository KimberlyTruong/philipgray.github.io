### Who?

**Github:** [toastdriven](https://github.com/toastdriven?tab=overview&from=2021-08-01&to=2021-08-04)

**Project:** [Itty](https://github.com/toastdriven/itty3)

**Date:** March 2013

### Why?

Daniel Lindsley was the core maintainer of several "failed" Python projects. Lindsley cites community hostility, self-doubt, and the project no longer being useful as reasons that ultimately led Lindsley to leave all open source communities. They have only contributed to private repositories since 2014.

The main issue that caused Lindsley's projects' failure was lack of proper documentation which ultimately allowed newer projects like Flask to gain significantly more users despite both projects (Flask and Itty) performing relatively simlar tasks at the time. Lindsley found some contributors also avoided certain issues or just the project as a whole because they didn't know how the project worked or where it was headed.

> "'Am I wasting two hours of my life for something that's never going to get merged and I'm going to have to maintain indefinitely?'" (11:08)

As Lindsley's project became less popular, they felt their efforts were no longer important and worried they'd end up spending all their time on a project with no future. Lindsley felt this was the reason the other contributors left as well.

As the project lost popularity, Lindsley witnessed the community get more hateful with the severity of the comments increasing over time.

> "You should consider yourself a success once you first start to get haters, so good for you. somebody bashes your software you're like yes I say yes but I'm really thin skinned so it's actually really bad. I'm like crying first." (14:03)

Although Lindsley encourages others to ignore this toxicity, they also acknowledge it's almost impossible to do so. These comments took a toll on Lindsley's mental wellbeing, and was the final reason that caused them to leave open source.

### Interventions

Lindsley offered many interventions. They expressed that although they had "failed" in their projects, open source projects are still important and good open source communities are possible.

They encouraged others to "never feel obligated," as this "leads to guilt, resentment, and burnout". (14:40) They emphasized that if contributors aren't getting compensated for their work, they shouldn't feel obligated to work constantly either and should take time for themselves instead.

Lindsley especially emphasized the need to let go of perfection and to communicate with others in the community. Lindsley encouraged others to let people in and not be afraid to ask for support. Lindsley claimed one of the best ways to ask for support is to push out new versions for development rather than working on something until it's perfect (because Lindsley believed it likely never will be). This would keep the contributor from burnout as well as encourage newer contributors to add to the project and expand the community.
