### Who?

**Github:** [Myron Marston](https://github.com/myronmarston)

**Project:** [RSpec](https://rspec.info/)

**Date:** 09/23/2018

### Why?

One of the RSpec project leads, Myron Marston [announced](https://rspec.info/blog/2018/09/jon-rowe-and-sam-phippen-are-rspecs-new-leads/) that they were leaving the project. Myron brought up how since their first contribution (to RSpec), eight years ago, a lot of things have happened in their life. Some of which have resulted in Myron moving further and further away from the project. One of their jobs switched languages from Ruby (the language RSpec is written in), and later on his other job used Java.

> I changed employers from Moz to Square last year
> I stopped using Ruby as my primary language about 3 years ago (at Moz we switched to Elixir and my team at Square is using Java)

Plus, Myron mentioned that they have children now! 

> I have 3 kids now (when I started working on RSpec I didn't have any!)
>
> I no longer have the kind of time I used to work on open source

Later on they mention that they're often no longer enjoying working on the project anymore either even when they have the time, nor are they really using the project as well.

> As much as I have enjoyed working on RSpec for the better part of a decade, I rarely have the time anymore, and when I do have the time, I often don't enjoy it. I'm also no longer a regular user of RSpec.
