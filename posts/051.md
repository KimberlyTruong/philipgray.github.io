### Why?

This contributor shares second-hand reasoning behind his peers leaving open source communities in an episode of Dirk and Swap (Discussions on Open Source). These peers were autistic and as a result struggled even more from community hostility, which he cited to be the most significant reason these contributors disengaged.

> "Sometimes they don't know how to deal with people because technology is where they find the solace; so sometimes they are also misunderstood because they just openly shared their feelings and behavior at the same time the culture itself sometimes becomes so toxic" (10:06)

Although not explicitly stated, he also implied that health issues (more specifically autism) caused these contributors to be more overwhelmed by the toxicity within their open source communities.
