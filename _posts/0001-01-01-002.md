### Who?

**GitHub:** [Jeremy D. Miller](https://github.com/jeremydmiller)

**Project:** [FubuMVC](https://fubumvc.github.io/)

**Date:** 04/03/2014

### Why?

This contributor was working on a project called [FubuMVC](https://fubumvc.github.io/) which was an open source .Net framework. In a [post on their blog](https://jeremydmiller.com/2014/04/03/im-throwing-in-the-towel-in-fubumvc/), Jeremy mentioned two key reasons for why they disengaged. The first of which was not enough time, which led them to looking at the opportunity cost.

> On the downside, it’s also been a massive opportunity cost because of  all the things I haven’t learned or done in the meantime because FubuMVC takes up so much of my time and that’s the main reason that it has to  stop now.

The other issue was that the project was lacking support. They felt that because they hadn't invested much time in making it accesible to newcomers. 

> We also didn’t focus hard enough on creating a good,  frictionless getting started story to make FubuMVC approachable for newbies. 

Reflecting on why they lacked support, the contributor felt that there was numerous opportunities to really promote the project such as:

> At one time I think I went almost 2 years without writing any blog posts about fubu and I only gave 3-4 conference talks on FubuMVC total over  the past 5 years.  I believe that if we’d just tried to get FubuMVC in  front of many more people earlier and generated more interest we might  have had enough community to do more, document more, and ground away the friction in FubuMVC faster through increased feedback.
