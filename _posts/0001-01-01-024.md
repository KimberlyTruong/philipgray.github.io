### Who?

**Github:** [Elana Hashman](https://github.com/ehashman)

**Project:** [auditwheel](https://github.com/pypa/auditwheel)

**Date:** 04/10/2019

### Why?

Elana [mentioned in their blog]() that they were stepping down as a the core maintainer, citing the challenge of maintaining this tool. 

> auditwheel is a very technically challenging tool to maintain. It requires deep knowledge of dynamic linking, ELF binaries, and symbol versioning on the Linux platform.

They go on to mention that it isn't necessarily the "technical challenge" rather it's the time commitment that comes with the challenge. 

> While this is very exciting technical work, it's not the sort of project that I can work on sustainably in my free time and off hours. I'm currently the only active auditwheel maintainer, and I don't feel like I can give the project the attention it deserves on an ongoing basis, especially given community interest in updating the manylinux specification and supporting new platform policies.
