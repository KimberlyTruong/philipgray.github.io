### Who?

**GitHub:** [Steve Wilkerson](https://github.com/wilkers-steve)

**Project:** [openstack-helm](https://opendev.org/openstack/openstack-helm/)

**Date:** 05/19/2020

### Why?

After switching jobs (from one that worked with OpenStack) to a job (that did not work with OpenStack) this contributor sent an [email to the mailing list](http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-discuss/2020-May/014977.html) letting people know that they no longer had the time to interact with the community and as a result, disengaged. 

> I switched jobs a few months back that took me in a different direction from my previous employer, and as a result I've not had the time to remain involved with the OpenStack community (especially as my day job no longer involves working with OpenStack).

> I think it's best that I step down from the openstack-helm core reviewer team, as I can't realistically make the time to do my due diligence in providing thorough, useful code reviews.
