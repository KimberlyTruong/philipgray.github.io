According to GitHub's <a href="https://opensourcesurvey.org/2017/">2017 Open Source Survey</a>, of the software developers (and related positions) surveyed, they found that:
* 94% reported using open source in their professional work
* 84% reported having dependencies in their code base

Recent research into Open Source has been about trying to calculate the "truck factor" of a project. While it's a fairly grim term, "truck factor" or "bus factor" is thrown around a lot in the software industry. Truck/bus factor means, <a href="http://www.agileadvice.com/2005/05/15/agilemanagement/truck-factor/">“The number of people on your team who have to be hit with a truck before the project is in serious trouble.”</a> This research has shown (while not incredibly reliable) that many open source projects have a very low "truck factor" which suggests that they're in danger if something were to happen to contributors. Rather than worrying about the chances someone is going to get hit by a  truck or bus, we felt it's important to look into why people disengage from these projects instead.

There's been some research as well on disengagement in Open Source but none of which have utilized gray literature until now. By analyzing blogposts, tweets, podcasts, conference talks, we get a more unfilitered, and often raw look at what motivates people to leave. 

# Methodology

We conducted an analysis of two different mediums of gray literature, text-based (blog posts, emails, and tweets) and audiovisual-based (recorded conference talks, and podcasts) in order to better our understanding of why contributors disengage. 

## Text-based Literature

For text-based literature, we did the following to collect the data:

* Created a list of blog posts, tweets, emails, and articles related to Open Source
  * Searched the top ten pages of results for Google for a variety of keywords
* Filtered out results that did not mention disengagement
* Replaced third party explanations with first party
  * E.g. Changing from news articles about contributors disengaging to the actual post by the contributor

## Audiovisual-based Literature

For audiovisual-based literature, we split our methods up into two. For podcast based literature we did the following:
