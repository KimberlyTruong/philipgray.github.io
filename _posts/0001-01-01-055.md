### Who?

**Github:** [dcramer](https://github.com/dcramer)

**Project:** [Sentry](https://github.com/getsentry)

**Date:** April 2014

### Why?

David Cramer cited his reasons for disengaging from open source in the past at PyCon PL 2014 before he began monetizing his current project, Sentry. The primary reason he paused his open source contributions to various projects was lack of compensation.

> "if you're working on something, you should get paid for it. And so like it has to be sustainable. This is part of that like you never want to lose money; I promise you I've quit so many projects because I could not make them turn any kind of reasonable profit." (10:56)

He claims there was no reason for him to continue contributing to open source if he was losing money, and he considered his time to be just as valuable as money.
