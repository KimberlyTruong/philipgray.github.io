### Who?

**Github:** [Jean-Baptiste Quéru](https://github.com/jbqueru)

**Project:** [Android Open Source Project](https://source.android.com/)

**Date:** 08/01/2013

### Why?

Jean-Baptiste Quéru [announced](https://plus.google.com/u/0/112218872649456413744/posts/9HHRURorE7g) that they were quitting the Android Open Source Project.

> Well, I see that people have figured out why I’m quitting AOSP.

What prompted this was the lack of support from Qualcomm (the device manufacturer) who were not providing the factory images and driver binaries for the project. 

> There’s no point being the maintainer of an Operating System that  can’t boot to the home screen on its flagship device for lack of GPU support, especially when I’m getting the blame for something that I  don’t have authority to fix myself and that I had anticipated and  escalated more than 6 months ahead.
