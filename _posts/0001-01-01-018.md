### Who?

**Project:** [LLVM](https://llvm.org/)

**Date:** 05/02/2018

### Why?

In a [email](https://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2018-May/122922.html) sent to the LLVM developer mailing list, this contributor listed a few reasons as to why they were leaving the project that they had been working on for a number of years. They listed a few main reasons for leaving the project. 

The first of which was that the community was changing, along with the inflow of the social injustice movement.  

> The community change I cannot take is how the social injustice
> movement has permeated it. When I joined llvm no one asked or cared
> about my religion or political view. We all seemed committed to just
> writing a good compiler framework.

The next was the adoption of a code of conduct.

> Somewhat recently a code of conduct was adopted. It says that the community tries to welcome people of all "political belief". Except those whose political belief mean that they don't agree with the code of conduct. Since agreement is required to take part in the conferences, I am no longer able to attend.

The nail in the coffin was LLVM associating with an organization that they described as, "openly discriminates based on sex and ancestry."

> The last drop was llvm associating itself with an organization that openly discriminates based on sex and ancestry (1,2). This goes directly against my ethical views and I think I must leave the project to not be associated with this.
