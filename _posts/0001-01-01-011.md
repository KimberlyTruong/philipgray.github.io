### Why?

**Project:** [systemd](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/)

**Date:** 11-16-2014

### Who?

Our contributor talks about being outted from their "tribe," systemd in their [blog post](https://err.no/personal/blog/tech/debian/2014-11-16-23-55_resigning_from_pkg-systemd/). As a little bit of background information on tribes our contributor says, 

> Debian and its various maintainer teams are a bunch of tribes (with possibly Debian itself being a supertribe).  Unlike many other situations, you can be part of multiple tribes.  I’m still a member of the DSA tribe for instance.  Leaving pkg-systemd means leaving one of my tribes.

Unfortunately, this wasn't just a choice that our contributor made, as they claim it's more forced than anything else. 

> It hurts even more because it feels like a forced exit rather than because I’ve lost interest or been distracted by other shiny things for long enough that you don’t really feel like part of a tribe.  

Later on they describe why they were forced out of their tribe, and sadly it's due to constant hostility from the community. 

> Now, how did I, standing stout and tall, get forced out of my tribe? I’ve been a DD for almost 14 years, I should be able to weather any storm, shouldn’t I?  It turns out that no, the mountain does get worn down by the rain.  It’s not a single hurtful comment here and there. There’s a constant drum about this all being some sort of conspiracy and there are sometimes flares where people wish people involved in systemd would be run over by a bus or just accusations of incompetence.

This ultimately led them disengaging from the project. 

> This morning, I resigned as a member of the systemd maintainer team. I then proceeded to leave the relevant IRC channels and announced this on twitter.
