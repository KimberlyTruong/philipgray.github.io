### Who?

**Github:** [Dmitry Shachnev](https://github.com/mitya57) and [Lisandro Damián Nicanor Pérez Meyer](https://github.com/perezmeyer)

**Project:** [Qt](https://www.qt.io/)

**Project:** 08/18/2020

### Why?

Both of these maintainers quit for the same reasons outlined in this [blog post](https://perezmeyer.blogspot.com/2020/08/stepping-down-as-qt-6-maintainers.html). They didn't go into specifics, but they did provide two reasons. The first of which was a lack of time.

> **Note 20200818 12:12 ARST:** I was asked if the move has anything to do with code quality or licensing. The answer is a huge **no**, Qt is a ***\*great\**** project which we love. As stated before it's mostly about lack of free time to properly maintain it. 

 The other issue was the lack of support where they specifically mentioned not enough build power.

> We ***\*love\**** Qt, but it's a huge codebase and requires time and  build power, both things that we are currently lacking, so we decided  it's time for us to step down and pass the torch. And a new major  version seems the right point to do that.
