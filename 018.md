### Who?

**Github:** [Rafael Avila de Espindola](https://github.com/espindola)

**Project:** [LLVM](https://llvm.org/)

### Why?

In a [email](https://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2018-May/122922.html) sent to the LLVM developer mailing list, this contributor listed a few reasons as to why they were leaving the project that they had been working on for a number of years. They listed a few main reasons for leaving the project. 

The first of which was that the community was changing, along with the inflow of the social injustice movement.  

> The community change I cannot take is how the social injustice
> movement has permeated it. When I joined llvm no one asked or cared
> about my religion or political view. We all seemed committed to just
> writing a good compiler framework.

The next was the adoption of a code of conduct.

> ```
> Somewhat recently a code of conduct was adopted. It says that the
> community tries to welcome people of all "political belief". Except
> those whose political belief mean that they don't agree with the code
> of conduct. Since agreement is required to take part in the
> conferences, I am no longer able to attend.

The nail in the coffin was LLVM associating with an organization that they described as, "openly discriminates based on sex and ancestry."

> directly against my ethical views and I think I must leave the project
> to not be associated with this.
