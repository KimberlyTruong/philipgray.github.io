### Who?

**Projects:** [debhelper](https://packages.debian.org/source/sid/debhelper), [alien](https://packages.debian.org/sid/alien), [dpkg-repack](https://packages.debian.org/sid/dpkg-repack), [debmirror](https://packages.debian.org/sid/debmirror)

### Why?

This long time contributor, who had joined the Debian ecosystem in 1996, announced they were leaving in an [email](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2014/11/msg00174.html) sent to the Debian developers mailing list. Citing the Debian consitution as problematic, they wrote:

> If I have one regret from my 18 years in Debian, it's that when the
> Debian constitution was originally proposed, despite seeing it as
> dubious, I neglected to speak out against it. It's clear to me
> now that it's a toxic document, that has slowly but surely led Debian
> in very unhealthy directions.

Which resulted in multiple packages being orphaned, some of which include:

> Note that this also constitutes an orphaning as upstream of debhelper, alien, dpkg-repack, and debmirror.
