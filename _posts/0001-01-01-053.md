### Who?

**Github:** [searls](https://github.com/searls)

**Project:** [Ruby](https://github.com/ruby)

### Why?

Justin Searls cites one issue that led them to disengage from open source communities for a period of time at RailsConf 2019. At the time, they actively contributed to Ruby, specifically [Ruby setup](https://github.com/ruby/setup-ruby), and was one of its few contributors. Justin believed they lacked support from their peers and did not have enough time to implement everything they wanted.

> "When you're solo, you know that your time is limited and so if we add too many gems, things like upgrades and workarounds may eventually consume more time than we have to give the app." (8:08)

This disappointment led Justin to take a break from open source. Justin returned later on when they joined a software agency working on open source projects, [Test Double](https://github.com/testdouble), and remains active today.
