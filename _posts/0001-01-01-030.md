### Who?

**Github:** [Ryan Bigg](https://github.com/radar)

**Project:** All (specific projects are unknown)

**Date:** 11/16/2015

### Why?

> As of today I am quitting all maintenance roles / responsibilities of any open source project I am involved in.

Ryan Bigg announced that he was disengaging in one of [his blog posts](https://ryanbigg.com/2015/11/open-source-work). Citing a variety of reasons, he first talks about his life a little bit. He talks about the opportunity cost of working on these projects (for free), what he's missing out on as a result, and how it's a "great recipe" for burnout.

> I do not have the time or energy to invest in open source any more. I am not being paid at all to do any open source work, and so the work that I do there is time that I could be spending doing “life stuff”, or  writing. It is not fair to expect me to do *even more work* outside of my regular work, and then not get fairly compensated (time or money) for it. It’s also a great recipe for burnout and making me just generally grumpy. 

Ryan then brings up it's also causing him to feel guilty about not addressing issues related to open source immediately. 

> To have an open source email sit in the inbox for days or weeks at a  time just leads me to feeling more guilty about not having found time +  energy to get to it yet.

With all that being said, he then reiterates his decision to disengage. 

> It’s for this reason that I’ve decided to end all my engagements with  open source effective today. I will not be responding to any comments,  issues or pull requests that get filed on any repository that I am in  charge of. The only thing I will be responding to (in this regard) is  volunteers who want to take over the maintenance of the projects.
